When summer heat increases in Gujarat, a shade net helps protect your roses. Keep these points in mind:

- Use **50% shade net or less**.
- **White shade net** is preferable as it reflects heat better.

**Why not more than 50%?** More than 50% shade net will reduce temperature, but it will also reduce light intensity. Roses need 50,000 lux light intensity for good growth and blooming. Below 30,000 lux, growth slows down. Even with 50% shade net in harsh summer sun, light stays above 30,000 lux—sufficient for roses.
