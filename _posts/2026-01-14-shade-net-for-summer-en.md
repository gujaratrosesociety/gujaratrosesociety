When summer heat increases in Gujarat, a shade net helps protect your roses. Keep these points in mind:

- Use **50% shade net or less**. More than 50% blocks too much light and roses will suffer.
- **White shade net** is preferable as it reflects heat better than black.

Too much shade reduces flowering and weakens growth. The goal is to reduce heat stress while ensuring adequate sunlight reaches your plants.
