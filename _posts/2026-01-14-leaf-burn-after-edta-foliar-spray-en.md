Seeing leaf burn after foliar spraying EDTA micronutrients? Two common causes:

1. **High TDS water** - If your water is 1500+ TDS, the dissolved salts can damage leaves. Switch to RO water for foliar applications.

2. **Dry plants** - Plants that aren't well watered before spraying are more prone to burn. Always ensure your roses are properly hydrated before foliar feeding.
