Unlike growth promoters that are used every 15 days to a month, seaweed-based biostimulants can be used weekly. These products can be mixed with your regular weekly feeding.

## Takat (Naval)

**Takat** by Naval is a seaweed-based biofertilizer that contains:

- Amino acids
- Seaweed extract
- Fulvic acid and humic acid
- Alginic acids

- Plant hormones

This combination of naturally occurring compounds supports healthy growth, flowering, and fruiting.

**Dosage:** 1 ml per liter of water for root application

## Biovita (PI)

**Biovita** by PI is a biostimulant based on *Ascophyllum nodosum* seaweed extract. It provides over 60 naturally occurring nutrients and plant development substances including enzymes, proteins, cytokinin, amino acids, vitamins, gibberellins, and auxins.

**Benefits:**
- Improves root and shoot growth
- Enhances flower and fruit set
- Increases stress tolerance against drought, heat, and other abiotic stresses
