Want more branches instead of just one long stem? **Phyton** (by Naval) is a solid tool for breaking apical dominance and "waking up" side buds.

However, it isn't a "spray and forget" product. Two rules if you use it:

**Use your brain:** Don't just spray because it's on the shelf. You have to decide if the timing is right. Only use it when the plant is healthy, active, and the weather is favorable for new growth.

**Don't follow the prescribed rate:** The dosage on the bottle is often too high for roses. The prescribed rate of 5 ml per liter for drenching and 3 ml per liter for foliar spray is causing burning. Start with a much lower concentration and find what works for your specific varieties.

**Note:** We do not prescribe a specific frequency and dose yet.

**Important:** Do not use Phyton together with products that promote apical dominance, such as Utkarsh Bhim Plus. Keep a good gap between applications of these products. As mentioned on the label, do not mix Phyton with any other fertilizers.

Branching is great, but only if the plant is ready for it.
