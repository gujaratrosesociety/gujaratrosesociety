**Bhim Plus** is a growth promoter by Utkarsh Agro Chem (Surat) that contains two key plant hormones:

- **Gibberellic Acid (GA)** - Promotes growth, flowering, and yield by stimulating cell division and elongation, and improving photosynthesis
- **Cytokinin** - Prevents the aging effects (leaf fall) that Gibberellic Acid can cause

This balanced combination gives you the growth benefits of GA while the Cytokinin counteracts its negative effects.

**Application Methods:**
- Foliar spray (apply in the evening)
- Root application

**Dosage:** 0.4 to 0.6 ml per liter of water

**Frequency:** Every 15 days to a month

**Note:** Utkarsh also makes a product called "Bhim" (without "Plus") which is different from Bhim Plus. Make sure you get the correct product.
