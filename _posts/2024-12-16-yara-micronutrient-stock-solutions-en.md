The scientific document published by Yara on nutrient solutions for greenhouse crops provides valuable guidance for rose cultivation. This reference material has proven extremely useful for rose growers seeking professional-grade feeding programs.

## The Challenge: Precise Micronutrient Measurement

The Yara document specifies micronutrient levels in PPB (parts per billion). When converting these to PPM (parts per million) and attempting to achieve exact numbers, we encounter a significant practical challenge.

The main difficulty is that measuring such tiny quantities of micronutrients is extremely difficult. Weighing a few milligrams each time is not practical and leaves room for significant errors that can affect plant nutrition.

## The Solution: Stock Solution Approach

We've developed a practical solution: create a concentrated liquid stock solution. By taking small, measured amounts from this stock solution and adding them to your final feeding solution, you can achieve exact PPM levels consistently.

We've completed all the calculations and developed three different stock solution formulas to match the Yara micronutrient ratios:

## Stock Solution Formulas

### 1. Utkarsh Double Combi Stock Solution

**To make 1 liter of stock solution:**
- 10 gm Utkarsh Double Combi
- 20 gm Fe EDDHA (6% Fe)
- 1.75 gm Mn EDTA
- 0.6 gm Boron
- 0.08 gm Molybdenum

**Usage:** Add 10 ml of this stock solution to 10 liters of water to achieve the exact Yara micronutrient ratio.

### 2. Stock Solution Using Raw Ingredients

**To make 1 liter of stock solution:**
- 0.65 g Base micronutrient product
- 2.12 g Fe-EDDHA (6% Fe)
- 0.21 g Mn-EDTA (10% Mn)
- 0.094 g Boron (20% B)
- 0.0080 g Ammonium Molybdate (52% Mo)

**Usage:** Add 10 ml of this stock solution to 10 liters of water.

### 3. Rexolin CXK Stock Solution

**To make 1 liter of stock solution:**
- 4.67 g Rexolin CXK
- 20.69 g Fe EDDHA (6% Fe)
- 1.05 g Mn EDTA (12% Mn)
- 0.75 g Boron (20% B)
- 0.42 g Cu EDTA (12% Cu)
- 0.088 g (≈ 88 mg) Ammonium Molybdate (52% Mo)

**Usage:** Add 10 ml of this stock solution to 10 liters of water.

## Benefits of the Stock Solution Approach

This method offers several significant advantages:

1. **Accuracy** - Once properly prepared, you get precise amounts every time
2. **Simplicity** - Only need to measure liquid, not powder
3. **Time-saving** - No need to weigh tiny amounts daily
4. **Consistency** - Same nutrient levels in every feeding
5. **Error reduction** - Fewer measurements = fewer mistakes

## Practical Application

Choose the most suitable formula based on the products you have available:
- Use Formula #1 if you have Utkarsh Double Combi
- Use Formula #2 if you have individual micronutrients
- Use Formula #3 if you work with Rexolin CXK

Store stock solutions in a cool, dark place and use within 2-3 months for best results.

## Conclusion

Combining Yara's scientific guidance with our local calculations creates a practical solution for Gujarat's rose growers. This stock solution method bridges the gap between scientific precision and everyday practicality, making professional-grade rose nutrition accessible to all growers.

The formulas we've developed eliminate the guesswork and measurement challenges while maintaining the proven nutrient ratios recommended by leading horticultural scientists.
