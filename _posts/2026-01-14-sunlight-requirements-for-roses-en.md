Different rose types have different sunlight needs:

| Rose Type | Minimum Sunlight |
|-----------|------------------|
| HT / Dutch | 6 hours |
| Floribunda | 5 hours |
| Miniflora / Miniature | 4 hours |

If natural sunlight is limited, grow lights are an option. Some growers in Bangalore have successfully grown roses under artificial lighting.
