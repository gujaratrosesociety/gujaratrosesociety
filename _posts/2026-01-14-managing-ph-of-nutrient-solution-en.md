Most fertilizer mixes—especially with tap or well water—tend to be alkaline or not acidic enough for optimal rose health.

**To lower pH (pH Down):**

- **Organic Acids:** Citric acid or vinegar are gentle choices for minor adjustments.
- **Commercial pH Down:** Utkarsh, Katyayani, and Radongrow all make pH Down in liquid form. Radongrow also offers a powder format.
- **Phosphoric Acid:** Most cost-effective, but adds phosphorus (P) to your mix. Account for this in your fertilizer calculations.

**To raise pH (pH Up):**

- **PI Biovita:** Can be used as a pH up solution.
- **Commercial pH Up:** Utkarsh, Katyayani, and Radongrow all make pH Up products.

Taking control of pH ensures your nutrients aren't "locked out" by water chemistry, but delivered directly to your roses.
