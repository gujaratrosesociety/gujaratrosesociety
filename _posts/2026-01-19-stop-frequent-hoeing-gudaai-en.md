Frequent hoeing disturbs the delicate white feeder roots, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Once these roots are established, they should not be disturbed.

## Why Avoid Frequent Hoeing?

The white feeder roots are the primary roots responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. These delicate roots grow near the surface and are easily damaged by hoeing. When damaged, the plant must spend energy regenerating these roots instead of producing growth and flowers.

## How to Maintain Aeration Without Damage

### Aquarium Pump Method

Use Sanjoy Mukherjee's technique: run an aquarium air pump in the water or water + fertilizer solution for 20 minutes before applying. This increases the oxygen level in the water, which in turn increases oxygen at the roots and keeps the media aerobic.

### Beneficial Microbes

Regularly add good microbes to your growing media. These beneficial organisms:

- Improve soil structure naturally
- Create air pockets in the media
- Break down organic matter
- Help roots absorb nutrients more efficiently

### Mulching to Prevent Weeds

If you find yourself hoeing frequently to control weeds or grass, use mulching instead:

- **Wood mulch:** Apply a layer of wood chips or bark around your roses
- **Mulch fabric:** Use UV-resistant landscape fabric that allows air, light, and water to pass through but blocks sunlight from reaching the soil surface, preventing weed and grass growth

Both methods suppress weeds without disturbing the roots.

## Applies to All Growing Conditions

This advice applies to roses in both pots and ground soil. Whether you're growing in soil, cocopeat, or cinder, protect your white feeder roots to ensure better growth and more abundant flowering.

**Remember:** Healthy roots = healthy roses!
