Rose leaves have a waxy coating that causes water droplets to bead up and roll off. This means your foliar sprays—fertilizers or pesticides—don't actually reach the leaf surface properly.

A spreader sticker solves this. It breaks the surface tension of water, allowing the spray to spread evenly across the leaf and stick to it. Without one, much of your spray simply drips to the ground.

**Product options:**

Many companies make spreader stickers. Two commonly available ones are:

- **Apsa 80** by Amway – also has the benefit of pulling water pH slightly towards the acidic side
- **Silspread** by Utkarsh Agrochem

Add the recommended amount to your spray tank and you'll notice the difference immediately—better coverage, better results.
