Many TDS meters have x10 or x100 indicators that are easy to miss.

We often see growers report water TDS of "170" but when they share a photo, there's a small "x10" next to the reading. Their actual TDS is 170 x 10 = **1700**.

Always check for the multiplier symbol on your meter display before recording your reading.
