Hi everyone, I wanted to share a change I've made to my feeding routine that has made a huge difference.

We all know that adjusting pH is essential, but doing the "add acid, check, repeat" cycle in small 10-liter buckets is a massive time-sink. It feels like you spend more time chasing the right pH level than actually feeding the plants.

I've started using one large drum to dissolve everything at once, and it's a game-changer.

By dissolving the fertilizers and adjusting the pH in one big batch, I only have to get the balance right once. Doing this in a single batch has easily cut my prep time in half.

To make it even easier, I use a small motor and a long pipe to deliver the water. No more carrying heavy buckets back and forth—I just stay at the drum and move the hose around the garden. It saves so much effort and ensures every rose gets the exact same pH and nutrient balance.

If you're still mixing bucket-by-bucket, I highly recommend switching to a drum and pump setup. Your back (and your schedule) will thank you!
