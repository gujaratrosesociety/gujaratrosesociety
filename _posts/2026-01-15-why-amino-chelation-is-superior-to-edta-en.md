Amino acid chelates offer several advantages over EDTA chelates for delivering micronutrients to plants. Here's a detailed comparison:

| Parameter | Amino Acid Chelates | EDTA Chelates |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Type of Chelates | Natural, organic | Synthetic, inorganic |
| Stability Constant & Molecular Weight | Correct stability constant and low molecular weight | High stability constants and larger molecular weights |
| Foliar Absorption Mechanism | Small molecules allow higher penetration rates | Larger molecules with lower penetration rates |
| Nutritional Mobility in Plants | Higher mineral mobility | Relatively immobile compared to Amino Acid Chelates |
| Mineral Translocation in Plants | Faster translocation through Phloem & Xylem | Less translocation through Phloem & Xylem |
| Assimilation Rate | Assimilates more effectively (over 60%) | Lower assimilation rate |
| Proven Efficiency | Maximum nutrient uptake with limited environmental losses | Lower nutrient uptake with higher environmental losses |
| Biodegradability | Easily biodegradable | Resistant to biodegradation |
| Safety | Entirely safe for plants, animals, humans, & the environment | May become phytotoxic at higher concentrations, potentially contributing to heavy metal bioavailability |
| Costing | Lower dosages result in lower fertilizer costs | Higher dosages lead to increased fertilizer costs |
