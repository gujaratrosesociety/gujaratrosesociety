For rose growers wanting to keep their plants vibrant and green, the choice of iron chelate matters—especially for root feeding.

Fe EDDHA stands out as the best option for soil application. Here's why:

**Stability at High pH:** Roses often struggle with iron uptake in alkaline or hard water conditions. EDDHA remains fully available even in high pH soils where other chelates fail.

**Effective Root Delivery:** Unlike other forms, EDDHA doesn't lock up in the soil easily. The iron actually reaches your rose roots instead of becoming unavailable.

**Preventing Chlorosis:** Yellowing leaves with green veins indicate iron deficiency. EDDHA fixes this reliably through soil application, regardless of your water or soil quality.

## Iron Chelate Comparison

| Chelate Type | pH Availability |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Fe EDTA | Decreases above pH 6.3 |
| Fe DTPA | Decreases just above pH 7.0 |
| Fe EDDHA | 100% available between pH 4 to 9 |

**The Bottom Line:** EDDHA has a lower iron percentage (6%) compared to others, but availability is what counts. Use EDDHA for soil drenching to ensure your roses never go hungry for iron.
