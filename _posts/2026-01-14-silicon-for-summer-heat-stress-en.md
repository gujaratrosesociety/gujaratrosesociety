In summer heat, silicon fertilizer can help protect your rose leaves from stress. Silicon provides mechanical strength to plant cells, helping them fight heat, reduce moisture loss, and resist pathogens and insects.

Products like Utkarsh Silfert work well for this purpose. However, silicon fertilizers are very alkaline. Always adjust the pH of your final foliar solution before spraying—bring it down to 6.0 or below for optimal absorption.
