If your roses grow vigorously in summer but struggle in winter with the same fertilizer, the culprit is likely **the ratio of nitrate to ammonium nitrogen**.

Not all nitrogen forms are absorbed the same way. The ratio you use—and when—can mean the difference between healthy growth and problems like leaf burn, yellowing, or stunted growth despite "perfect" PPM readings.

## Understanding Nitrogen Forms

**NO₃⁻ (Nitrate):**
- Absorbed passively through mass flow
- Doesn't acidify the root zone
- Safe at higher concentrations
- Requires energy to reduce before use

**NH₄⁺ (Ammonium):**
- Actively absorbed by roots
- Requires immediate metabolic conversion
- Acidifies root zone during uptake
- Can become toxic if not metabolized quickly

## Why the Ratio Changes with Seasons

Roses metabolize nitrogen at different rates throughout the year based on:

**Light Intensity:** High light drives photosynthesis, providing energy and carbon skeletons to convert ammonium into amino acids. Low light = slow ammonium metabolism.

**Transpiration Rate:** High transpiration accelerates nutrient uptake and metabolism. Low transpiration = slow processing.

## Recommended Ratios

### Winter / Low Light: NO₃⁻ : NH₄⁺ = 95:5 or 100:0

In low light, roses cannot metabolize ammonium quickly enough. Accumulation causes:
- Leaf tip burn or necrosis
- Interveinal chlorosis
- Stunted growth despite adequate feeding
- Root damage in severe cases

Using primarily nitrate nitrogen allows safe absorption without metabolic stress.

### Summer / High Light: NO₃⁻ : NH₄⁺ = 75:25

High photosynthesis rates allow rapid ammonium assimilation, providing:
- **Faster uptake:** Ammonium is absorbed more rapidly than nitrate
- **Less energy required:** No reduction step needed
- **Growth promotion:** Rapid protein synthesis
- **pH management:** Acidifying effect counters alkaline drift

**Why not exceed 25% ammonium?** Even in summer, too much can overwhelm metabolic capacity, over-acidify the root zone, and cause cation competition issues.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use 100% nitrate year-round?**
A: Yes! It's safe and effective. You'll miss some growth-boosting benefits in summer, but many successful growers use this approach.

**Q: How quickly will I see results?**
A: Switching to lower ammonium in winter should reduce tip burn within 2-3 weeks. Increasing ammonium in summer shows faster growth within 1-2 weeks.

**Q: What about urea?**
A: Urea converts to ammonium, so treat it as ammonium when calculating ratios. Minimize it in winter.

## Conclusion

Adjusting your nitrate to ammonium ratio by season prevents winter toxicity, boosts summer growth, and eliminates mysterious leaf problems.

**Quick Reference:**
- **Winter/Low Light:** 95:5 or 100:0 (NO₃⁻ : NH₄⁺)
- **Summer/High Light:** 75:25 (NO₃⁻ : NH₄⁺)

Start by calculating your current ratio, then make gradual seasonal adjustments for healthier, more consistent growth year-round.
