You need to buy any one of these micronutrient products for your roses:

**EDTA Chelated Micronutrients**

- PR Agro Rexolin CXK

Many other companies make similar EDTA chelated micronutrient mixes.

**Amino Chelated Micronutrients**
- Utkarsh Ampro Combi

Many companies make amino chelated micronutrient mixes as well. Learn [why amino chelation is superior to EDTA]({{ site.baseurl }}/fertilizer/micronutrients/chelation/2026/01/14/why-amino-chelation-is-superior-to-edta-en.html).
