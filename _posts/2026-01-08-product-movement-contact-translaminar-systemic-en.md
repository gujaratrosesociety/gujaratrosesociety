When choosing an insecticide, fungicide, or acaricide, understanding how it moves (or doesn't move) through the plant is just as important as knowing what pest or disease it targets. The way a product redistributes inside or around your roses determines which pests you can reach, how thoroughly you need to spray, and whether a root drench or foliar spray is the right approach.

> **Disclaimer:** The information provided here is based on general experiences and practices. Every garden has unique conditions (climate, pest pressure, rose varieties, etc.). Use your judgment and adapt these recommendations to your specific situation. Don't follow blindly—observe your plants and adjust accordingly.

## Quick Overview: The Three Main Categories

**Contact:** Stays where you spray. Kills only what it directly touches.

**Translaminar:** Moves through the leaf blade from one side to the other.

**Systemic:** Moves inside the plant's vascular system (xylem, phloem, or both).

Understanding these differences helps you choose the right product and application method for the job.

## 1. Contact Products

### What It Means
Contact insecticides, acaricides, and fungicides stay on the surface where they land. They work only by direct hit or by leaving residue that pests/diseases touch later.

### For Insecticides & Acaricides
- **How it works:** Kills only what the spray droplet hits or what later crawls over the dried residue
- **Coverage is everything:** Hidden thrips under petals, spider mites on leaf undersides, or aphids tucked in growing tips will often escape if you miss them
- **Examples:** Many pyrethroid-based sprays, some neem oil formulations

### For Fungicides
- **How it works:** Creates a protective shield on the leaf surface
- **Prevention vs cure:** Prevents new infections on protected tissue but doesn't cure existing infections inside the leaf
- **Coverage matters:** Gaps in coverage = gaps in protection
- **Examples:** Sulfur, copper-based fungicides, chlorothalonil

### Practical Tip
When using contact products, spray thoroughly—top and bottom of leaves, stems, and hiding spots. Repeat applications are often needed because new growth won't be protected.

---

## 2. Translaminar Products

### What It Means
Translaminar products penetrate into the leaf tissue and move from the sprayed side to the opposite side of the **same leaf blade**. They don't necessarily spread to other leaves or throughout the plant.

### For Insecticides & Acaricides
- **How it works:** Reaches pests hiding on the underside of the leaf even if you only spray the top
- **Great for:** Spider mites, whiteflies, and thrips that feed on leaf undersides
- **Limitation:** Still localized to the leaf that was sprayed; doesn't protect the whole plant
- **Examples:** Abamectin (translaminar with some systemic properties), some formulations of spinosad

### For Fungicides
- **How it works:** Penetrates leaf tissue locally and can protect or treat that specific leaf better than a pure contact fungicide
- **Benefit:** Helps when infection is just starting inside the leaf tissue
- **Limitation:** Won't move to other leaves or systemically throughout the plant
- **Examples:** Some strobilurin fungicides have translaminar properties

### Practical Tip
Translaminar products are more forgiving than pure contact sprays, but you still need good coverage. They're excellent for hard-to-reach pests but won't protect new growth that emerges after application.

## 3. Systemic Products: Xylem, Phloem & Ambimobile

Systemic products move inside the plant's vascular system. But **how** they move—and where they end up—varies dramatically.

### A. Xylem-Mobile (Upward Systemic)

**What It Means:**
Moves with water flow in the xylem—from roots upward to stems and leaves. Movement is generally one-way (up) and follows transpiration.

#### For Insecticides & Acaricides
- **How it works:** Applied as a drench or spray, absorbed by roots or leaves, then transported upward
- **Best for:** Sap-sucking pests like aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies in actively growing, transpiring tissue
- **Limitation:** Weaker reach to areas with low transpiration (older leaves, shaded parts)
- **Examples:** Imidacloprid (systemic neonicotinoid)

#### For Fungicides
- **How it works:** Protects new foliage forming at the top of the plant
- **Best for:** Diseases in actively growing tissue (young shoots, new leaves)
- **Limitation:** Less effective in older, non-transpiring parts of the plant
- **Examples:** Metalaxyl, fosetyl-aluminum

**Practical Tip:**
Xylem-mobile products are excellent for drenches that protect new growth. Apply when plants are actively growing and transpiring.

### B. Phloem-Mobile (Source → Sink Movement)

**What It Means:**
Moves with sugars in the phloem, which can flow **both up and down** depending on where the plant is producing sugars (source) and where it's using them (sink).

#### For Insecticides & Acaricides
- **How it works:** Can reach sinks like buds, young shoots, flower buds, and even roots—wherever the plant is actively growing or storing energy
- **Best for:** Hidden feeding sites like buds and new flush where thrips often hide
- **Better redistribution:** More flexible than xylem-only products
- **Examples:** Spirotetramat, flonicamid

#### For Fungicides
- **How it works:** Moves toward active growing points where disease pressure is often highest
- **Best for:** Systemic infections that spread inside plant tissue
- **Benefit:** Better inside-plant redistribution than xylem-only products
- **Examples:** Some triazole fungicides (e.g., propiconazole)

**Practical Tip:**
Phloem-mobile products are excellent for reaching hidden pests and protecting buds/new growth. They're more forgiving if coverage isn't perfect, but timing and dose still matter.

---

### C. Ambimobile (Xylem + Phloem)

**What It Means:**
Moves in **both** xylem and phloem, giving the best whole-plant redistribution.

#### For All Product Types
- **How it works:** Can move upward with water and in multiple directions with sugars
- **Best redistribution potential:** Most forgiving when coverage is imperfect
- **Not magic:** Still requires proper dosing and timing
- **Examples:** Cyazofamid (fungicide), some newer insecticide chemistries

**Practical Tip:**
Ambimobile products offer the most flexibility but are often more expensive. They're worth it for tough-to-reach problems or when perfect coverage is difficult.

---

## Memory Hook: How to Remember

- **Contact** = Coverage is king. Miss it, and you miss the pest.
- **Translaminar** = Through the leaf. Top to bottom, but not plant-wide.
- **Xylem** = UP with water (roots → shoots → leaves).
- **Phloem** = UP + DOWN with sugars (source → sink).
- **Ambimobile** = BOTH directions. Best redistribution.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding how your pesticides and fungicides move isn't just academic—it's practical knowledge that helps you:
- **Save money** by choosing the right product for the job
- **Improve control** by matching application method to movement type
- **Reduce waste** by avoiding products that can't reach your target pest
- **Protect your roses** more effectively

Next time you pick up a spray bottle or prepare a drench, ask yourself: "Does this product move where I need it to go?" That one question will make you a smarter, more effective rose grower.
